# Wundergraph Plugins example
v 0.0.1 so it's a piece of crap. Not wundergraph lol, the plugin system built on top of it in this repo.

install dependencies and then run `npm run wunderplugins` and in another terminal run `npm run dev:wundergraph`

this will initial a directory sync from .wundergraph/plugins/** to .wundergraph/operations and then run wundergraph.
